    <h1>Blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus)</h1>
    <img src="./img/caple.jpg" alt="blobfish" width="400">
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish is a deep-sea fish that lives off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. 
        It inhabits depths of 600 to 1,200 meters (2,000 to 3,900 feet) where the pressure is 
        60 to 120 times greater than at sea level.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish has a gelatinous body with very little muscle mass. Its body is slightly 
        less dense than water, which allows it to float above the sea floor without expending 
        much energy. At depth, the blobfish looks like a normal fish, but when brought to the 
        surface, the rapid pressure change causes its body to expand and take on its famous 
        "blob-like" appearance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>
        Blobfish live in the deep waters of the Pacific Ocean. They feed on small crustaceans, 
        mollusks, and other organic matter that floats by. Due to the scarcity of food at such 
        depths, blobfish have evolved to conserve energy by remaining relatively stationary.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish is considered vulnerable due to deep-sea trawling activities that 
        accidentally catch them as bycatch. Their slow reproduction rate and specialized 
        habitat make them particularly susceptible to population decline.

    <h1>Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum)</h1>
    <img src="./img/axolotl.jpg" alt="axolotl" width="400">
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The axolotl, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is a unique amphibian native 
        to Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City. Unlike most amphibians, axolotls reach adulthood 
        without undergoing metamorphosis, retaining their larval features throughout their 
        lives. This phenomenon is called neoteny. They typically grow to 15-45 cm (6-18 inches) 
        in length and can live up to 15 years in captivity.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        Axolotls have distinctive feathery external gills that extend from the sides of their 
        heads, giving them a unique appearance. They have wide heads, lidless eyes, and a 
        broad, flat body with a long tail. Their skin can be various colors including wild-type 
        brown/green, leucistic (pale pink with black eyes), albino (golden/white with pink eyes), 
        and melanistic (all black). They have four legs with delicate fingers and toes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>
        In the wild, axolotls inhabit only the ancient lake system of Xochimilco in Mexico City. 
        They are carnivorous, feeding on small fish, worms, insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. 
        Axolotls are mostly nocturnal and use their keen sense of smell to locate prey. They 
        are bottom-dwellers, preferring cool, oxygen-rich water with plenty of aquatic vegetation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Regeneration Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        One of the most remarkable features of axolotls is their extraordinary regenerative 
        abilities. They can regrow entire limbs, parts of their brain, spine, and heart without 
        scarring. This incredible capability has made them valuable subjects for scientific 
        research in regenerative medicine and developmental biology.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>
        The axolotl is critically endangered in the wild due to urbanization, water pollution, 
        and the introduction of invasive species such as tilapia and perch. Their natural 
        habitat has been reduced to a few canals in Xochimilco. However, they are commonly 
        bred in captivity for the pet trade and scientific research, ensuring the species' 
        survival outside their natural environment.
